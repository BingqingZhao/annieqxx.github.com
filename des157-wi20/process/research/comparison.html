            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I want to do an interactive design on topics related to human carbon emissions and the environment. Therefore, I browsed some related websites. Among them, two impressed me very much. One is particularly organized. From layout to content to interactive design, I feel very human. The other one made me feel dull and confused from the beginning.
            <br/> &emsp;&emsp;The climatekids.nasa.gov is one of my favorite websites. It is a comprehensive introduction to environmental issues, like science education. But unlike other educational websites, the information on this website is based on simple hand-drawing. Every message is clear and easy to understand. And the overall page gives a very clear and unified feeling. It does not make users feel boring and impatient when browsing this page.
            <br/> &emsp;&emsp;First of all, I really like its layout. From its navigation to its information and content distribution, each part is very simple and clear. This is very easy for users to operate and understand. Then, its font, color, and shape are very uniform and harmonious. From top to bottom, the unified margin and padding look very comfortable and coherent. The spatial arrangement of the webpage is very reasonable.
            <br/> &emsp;&emsp;As for its content, a large part of users is for children. Unlike a serious scientific explanation website, the entire content of this website is expressed in the form of animation. The designer uses simple pictures to express their profound meaning. While conveying information, it also allows users to clearly understand the content.
            <br/> &emsp;&emsp;I really appreciate its overall style and the way it is expressed. The only thing that I think can be improved is its undo operation. Since this is a popular website, it has a lot of information content. It's easy to click on unwanted content. However, it seems that there is no link operation that can return to the previous step except for the general menu above.

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;For me，www.carbonfootprint.com is an extremely boring and ordinary website interaction design. The purpose of this website is to make a presence like a carbon calculator. People can get their own carbon emissions information by entering their own daily behavior and the use of basic living energy. Therefore, we can compare our carbon emissions with the average carbon emissions to arrive at the conclusion whether we have over-produced carbon. It is undeniable that the idea of ​​this website and the final comparative rendering are very creative. However, in my opinion, its website lacks interactivity and freshness.
            <br/> &emsp;&emsp;First of all, the design of this website does not have a clear layout design. We can see that its navigation is arranged from right to left. However, it may be due to the design of padding, the layout of the navigation and the information on the website are completely asymmetric. In other words, there is no direct connection between information and information. Its layout is not in line with design principles.
            <br/> &emsp;&emsp;Next, we can see that it has three information stations represented by icons. However, these three icons are completely directional and have no clear interaction. For example, when the user's mouse is over an icon, the icon should show what it represents. There is no such interaction on this site. And, as a user, I can't directly understand the link it wants to express or represent through the icon drawn by it.
            <br/> &emsp;&emsp;Finally, and the most important question, this website should be used to calculate carbon emissions by entering their own daily information. But from beginning to end, there is no clear introduction to tell users what to do first. What does this mean? How to do it? What should this process look like? Is all the information required? These are not available on this site. Therefore, during use, as a user, I have no idea what I should do.
            <br/> &emsp;&emsp;It makes me firm, having a clear layout and clear usage introduction is even more important than the content.
