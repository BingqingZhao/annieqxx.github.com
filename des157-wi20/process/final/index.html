Plastic products mixed with municipal waste and incinerated together will produce harmful gases, pollute the air and harm human health. It's hard to degrade will cause it to mix in the soil, affect crops' absorption of nutrients and moisture, and lead to reduced crop yields. Even more, according to research, there are 5.25 Trillion Pieces of Plastic Polluting Our Oceans. Marine life such as sea turtles can ingest these pieces of plastic and cause indigestion or blockage of the esophagus.</p>
